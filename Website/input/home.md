Welcome to the Fantabulous Season of '40! This is a hypertext essay about an entire season of blade-sport. And not just
any season, but the turbulent season of 30 BR. This close out to the Revolution, during the beginning of the unwinding
of the cruel destructive rule of the megalomaniacal Apollan Conglomerate, you'd expect that what should be a simple
season of sports drama between teams and players and coaches and all those types would definitely have more than its
fair share of interesting stories. Well, that's kind of an understatement. *This* Fantabulous Season ended up being
a big outright historical event. The story of *this* season is right up there with the stories of various revolutionary
groups such as the Les Violettes Dangereuses or even the Army of the Below for understanding how the Industrial Era was
ripped away from the cruel paws and claws of the barons. No, really. There is a reason you likely had a section on it
in your history classes in school.

I mean, it was probably just a paragraph or two. Usually in a bigger section about "The Follies of the Barons" in
describing the many latter-year scandals that rocked the 56 years during the Floating of the Great Kujiran Cities. But
it was in there! Wasn't it?

OK, I think it was important. So important I made an entire hypertext essay about a few "cadet officers" in the game of
blade-sport. Keep your eye out for new parts of the essay in the near future as my lovely patient editor/wife and I
wrap them up.
